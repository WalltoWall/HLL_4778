# Event

The Event document type represents a page on the site. All Events URLs are
prefixed with `/events` and have a URL based on the `UID` field. For example, if
the UID for an Event is `tiny-floats`, the final URL will be
`/events/tiny-floats`.

Events are managed in Prismic using two tabs: **Main** and **Body**.

- **Main**: Information about the event such as its title, URL and type.
- **Body**: Event page Content such as images and text.

All Event pages within the website start with the main header and end with the
main footer. All content (slices) on the page is designed to be responsive to
work on both mobile and desktop devices.

Event pages content in the **Body** tab is created using Slices. For more
information on Slices,
[refer to the Slice documentation](/story/slices-call-to-action--default).
