# Sponsors List

The Sponsors List custom type represents a listing of
[Sponsors](/story/document-types-sponsor--page) and is primarily used in
conjunction with the [Sponsors Slice](/story/slices-sponsors--default).

This document type is used to set the order of sponsors when it is selected via
the [Sponsors Slice](/story/slices-sponsors--default).
