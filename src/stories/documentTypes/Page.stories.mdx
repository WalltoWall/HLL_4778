# Event

The Page document type represents a page on the site. All Page URLs are based on
the `UID` field. For example, if the UID for an Page is `about-us`, the final
URL will be `/about-us`.

Pages are managed in Prismic using two tabs: **Main** and **Body**.

- **Main**: Information about the event such as its title, URL and type.
- **Body**: Event page Content such as images and text.

All pages within the website start with the main header and end with the main
footer. All content (slices) on the page is designed to be responsive to work on
both mobile and desktop devices.

Page content in the **Body** tab is created using Slices. For more information
on Slices,
[refer to the Slice documentation](/story/slices-call-to-action--default).
