# What is Prismic?

Prismic is a modern Content Management System (CMS).

## Quick intro

All content on the site is stored within [Prismic](https://prismic.io). When
content is updated in Prismic, the website is also updated to reflect the
changes.

### Hosted

Prismic is a hosted CMS. A hosted CMS means Prismic manages the servers used to
run the CMS. Traditional CMSs require the CMS to be hosted on your own server
which involves ensuring the server is properly maintained, secured, and made
fault-tolerant.

Using Prismic means not needing to worry about running a special server.

### Headless

Prismic is a headless CMS. Headless CMSs differ from traditional CMSs in that
they manage content separately from the public-facing website. In the case of
this website, the public-facing front-end is hosted on Netlify.

The separation of CMS and front-end allows the website to be very flexible,
modern, and fast.
