# Media Library

How to upload, edit, and delete media within Prismic.

## Supported files

Media such as images and PDF files can be uploaded to Prismic to serve on the
website. If the file is very large, such as video files, we recommend uploading
to a specialized service and integrating it into the site.

> ## ðŸš§ Important

> To maintain an accessible website, be sure to provide alt text to all images
> uploaded to Prismic. See the
> [ADA Compliance document](/admin/guides/accessibility-ada-compliance/) for
> more information.
