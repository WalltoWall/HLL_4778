# Getting Started with Prismic

Overview of the site's content management system.

## Quick intro

Prismic is your site's content management system (CMS) and is used to create and
edit content. Content is managed primarily through two ways: **Documents** and
**Slices**.

### Documents

Documents contain the content for pages on the site. Documents can also be used
as settings for other Documents. For example, a Document could contain
information for a blog post or product.

Several Document types have already been configured for your site. Each document
type is described in this site's sidebar under **Document Types**.

### Slices

Slices are used within most Documents to build content. They are configurable
blocks of content with a predefined look and feel. Think of these as the content
building blocks with which you'll assemble a page.

This is what a blog post might look like in Prismic. `Name` and `Summary` are
text fields while `Content` is made with Slices.

```
Blog Post
_________

Name:    My first blog post!
Summary: Learn how to use Prismic, a modern CMS.
Content: [Text slice]
         [Image slice]
         [Text slice]
```

Each Document type has its own set of available Slices.

## Logging in

Prismic is managed separately from the website and has its own login
credentials.

Depending on your service level, you will either have a single set of
credentials shared among all of the site's editors, or each editor will have
their own login. Wall-to-Wall uses their own separate account to access your
Prismic content.

You can always access Prismic by opening this documentation site and clicking
the "Open Prismic" button at the top of the page.

Alternatively, you can go to this URL directly:
<https://honolulupride.com/admin/>

## Editing pages and documents

Most of your interaction with the site will involve editing pages and documents
within Prismic.

Read about editing pages and documents in the **Editing Pages and Documents**
guide.
