# Editing Pages and Documents

How to edit pages and other content.

## Overview

Most of your interaction with the site will involve editing pages and documents
within Prismic. Prismic allows creating drafts, previews, and scheduled
publications. Prismic saves the history of every change in a document.

## Pages vs. Documents

When we talk about Pages and Documents, we are talking about the same thing from
Prismic's perspective. Pages are just a type of Document.

Certain Document types, however, are treated differently than others. Some
Documents will create publicly viewable pages on the site while others may only
be used as settings, such as blog categories.

Pages are the most general and direct way to create a page on the site. They
have a flexible set of Slices that allow you to add general information to the
site. Other Document types may include Slices that are made for a specific
use-case.

If the content you are adding to the site may be better suited for a specialized
Document type, be sure to use that specialized type as it may include a special
design or may be listed elsewhere automatically.

## Creating Documents and Pages

Creating Documents and Pages can be done using the **green Create new** button
in Prismic. This may also appear as a **green pencil icon**.

You will be prompted to select a Document type. Each document type is described
in this site's sidebar under **Document Types**.

The following document from Prismic describes how to create Documents:

- [How to create a new document](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/771684-create-a-new-document)

## Editing content

Documents usually contain several fields and Slice zones that allow you to
provide content for a page on the site. Depending on the type of field, Prismic
will tailor the interface to match the type of content it needs. For example,
you may see a WYSIWYG editor, a dropdown selector, or a map to select a
coordinate.

The following documents from Prismic describe how to edit different types of
fields:

- [How to edit Rich Text fields](https://user-guides.prismic.io/browse-documents-and-edit-content/editing-content/edit-and-format-a-rich-text-field)
- [How to edit Link fields](https://user-guides.prismic.io/browse-documents-and-edit-content/editing-content/links)
- [How to edit Image fields](https://user-guides.prismic.io/browse-documents-and-edit-content/editing-content/add-and-edit-images)

While editing your content, you can save drafts multiple times before
publishing.

## Previewing

Before publishing your new content, you may need to preview how it looks. After
saving your changes, you can click the "Preview" button to see the website with
your changes.

The following document from Prismic describes how to preview changes:

- [How to preview a document](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/768819-preview-a-document)

## Publishing

Once your changes are complete, you can publish your changes to the live site.
After publishing, your changes will be sent to the site's hosting provider to
automatically rebuild the site.

Your changes will show up on the live site in around five minutes.

> ## ðŸš§ Important
>
> Saving and publishing are two different actions. _Save_ and then _publish_
> your document to go live.

### Schedule a publish

Prismic allows scheduling your changes to publish automatically at a specified
date and time. This can be helpful if you are keeping information private until
an announcement elsewhere. You can group changes from multiple documents into a
single scheduled publish.

Prismic calls this Releases.

The following document from Prismic describe how to create and schedule a
Release:

- [How to create and add to a release](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/778328-create-and-add-to-a-release)

## Restore past versions

Prismic saves a copy of every published Document allowing you to reference or
restore a previous version at any point. This can be useful if content was
prematurely removed or only temporarily altered.

The following documents from Prismic describe how to use Document versions:

- [Versioning and restoring a document](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/778556-versioning-and-restoring-a-document)
- [Discover what changed in your documents](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/778597-discover-what-changed-in-your-documents)
