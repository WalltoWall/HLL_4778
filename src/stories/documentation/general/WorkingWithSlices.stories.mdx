# Working With Slices

An introduction to working with Slices, the reusable building blocks of Prismic.

## Overview

Slices are configurable blocks of content with a predefined look and feel. All
pages are made using these building blocks to ensure each page stays within with
the overall design language of the site.

Content editors do not need to know how to code to create well-designed pages.
Instead, Slices contain a preset collection of fields that allow the page author
to customize the content and media displayed.

A Page can contain any number of Slices in any order.

## Example of Slices in a Page

A hypothetical product page could be made with the following slices:

- **Hero Image** - Quick visual introduction to the product.
- **Text** - Text content describing the product.
- **Images** - Collection of product images.
- **Text** - Additional product information.
- **Call to Action** - Link to sign up for the product or to get more
  information.

Additional slices could be inserted anywhere within that list. The surrounding
slices will move around as necessary.
